# Hash

This repository hosts a collection of algorithms implemented in various programming languages, providing developers with a comprehensive resource for studying, experimenting with, 
and applying fundamental algorithms across different platforms.


## About

This project aims to bridge the gap between algorithm theory and practical implementation by offering clear, well-documented algorithm implementations in multiple programming languages. 
Whether you're a student learning algorithms, a software engineer preparing for technical interviews, or a researcher exploring algorithmic concepts, this repository provides a 
diverse range of language-specific implementations to suit your needs.


## Features

- **Multiple Programming Languages**: Explore algorithms implemented in Java, C++17, Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, Go, Rust, and more.
- **Clear Documentation**: Each algorithm comes with detailed documentation, including its purpose, inputs, outputs, complexity analysis, and usage instructions.
- **Consistent Interface**: Algorithms are designed with a consistent interface across different languages, ensuring ease of understanding and usage.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Robust unit tests are provided for each algorithm implementation, ensuring correctness and reliability.
