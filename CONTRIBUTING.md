# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to hash! We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels and backgrounds. By contributing to this project, you help us improve the quality and diversity of algorithm implementations available to the community.

## How to Contribute

To contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/niiad/hash.git
    ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the nature of your changes.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm
    ```

4. **Implement Your Changes**: Implement your algorithm or make improvements to existing implementations. Follow the project's coding conventions and guidelines.

5. **Write Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests for your algorithm implementation to ensure correctness and reliability.

6. **Update Documentation**: Update the documentation to include your new algorithm or changes. Provide clear instructions on how to use the algorithm and any relevant details.

7. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages that clearly explain the purpose of each commit.

    ```bash
    git commit -am "Add new algorithm: algorithm_name"
    ```

8. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/new-algorithm
    ```

9. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Once you have pushed your changes to your forked repository, submit a pull request to the main repository's `main` branch. In your PR description, provide a clear explanation of the changes you've made and why they should be merged.

10. **Review and Iterate**: Your PR will undergo review by project maintainers. Address any feedback or requested changes promptly. Iterate on your changes as necessary until they are approved.
